# Web Development Portfolio - CSY1063

## Overview
This is my web development portfolio website for the CSY1063 assignment.  
It demonstrates my projects, site report, video demo, and contact form, showcasing HTML, CSS, and responsive design skills.

## Pages

- **Home (`index.html`)**  
  Black background with white accents for a modern, premium look.  
  Navigation bar uses **Flexbox** for responsive layout.  
  Main sections are structured with **CSS Grid** for consistent spacing.

- **Projects (`project.html`)**  
  Projects displayed in **card layout** using CSS Grid.  
  Hover effects using `:hover` pseudo-class for interactive feedback.  
  Images and text are aligned for clarity and readability.

- **Site Report (`sitereport.html`)**  
  Structured with semantic HTML: `<section>` and `<article>` for accessibility.  
  Headings, paragraphs, and links are styled consistently with CSS.

- **Video Demo (`videoDemo.html`)**  
  Embedded videos using `<video>` element with responsive sizing.  
  Maintains website’s consistent design style.

- **Contact (`contact.html`)**  
  Responsive form using Flexbox layout.  
  Inputs and buttons styled with CSS, including focus states for accessibility.
