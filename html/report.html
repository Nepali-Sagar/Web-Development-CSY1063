            Learning web development has been a challenging yet rewarding
            experience. Beginning with no prior coding knowledge, I started by
            understanding the basic structure of HTML—tags, elements, and
            document flow. CSS initially felt overwhelming, especially concepts
            like the box model, positioning, and responsive design. One of my
            early struggles was aligning items properly across different screen
            sizes. However, through trial and error—and frequent use of browser
            developer tools—I gradually improved. I learned how to debug layout
            issues, validate my code, and ensure semantic markup. Using Git and
            GitHub was another learning curve, but committing regularly helped
            me track progress and revert mistakes. The biggest “up” was seeing
            my portfolio come to life; the biggest “down” was wrestling with
            mobile menu functionality, which I eventually solved using CSS Grid
            and media queries.

            This module has fundamentally changed how I approach problem-solving
            in a digital space. I now appreciate the importance of planning
            before coding, and how small details—like color contrast or font
            sizing—can significantly impact user experience. While I initially
            found CSS frustrating, I now enjoy the creative control it offers.
            Time management was a challenge, especially balancing this project
            with other coursework, but breaking the work into smaller tasks made
            it manageable. I’ve grown not only technically but also in my
            ability to learn independently, using online resources and
            documentation to fill knowledge gaps. This experience has sparked my
            interest in front-end development, and I’m motivated to learn more
            about JavaScript and accessibility in the future.

            I built the site using a mobile-first approach, starting with the
            HTML structure for each of the five required pages. I ensured
            semantic tags were used throughout—like &lt;header&gt;, &lt;nav&gt;,
            &lt;main&gt;, and &lt;footer&gt;—to improve accessibility and SEO.
            CSS was used to create a consistent layout across all pages, with a
            focus on responsiveness. I implemented a flexbox-based navigation
            bar that transforms into a hamburger menu on mobile devices. The
            project page uses CSS Grid to display items in a structured yet
            visually appealing way. Each page is linked through a unified menu,
            and the site maintains a cohesive visual identity across devices.

          <p class="content-text">
            I wanted a clean, professional, and accessible design. After
            researching modern portfolio examples, I chose a color palette of
            deep blue (#1e3a8a) for headings and accents, with a light gray
            (#f9fafb) for the background to ensure readability. The fonts were
            selected from Google Fonts: ‘Open Sans’ for body text due to its
            clarity on screens, and ‘Montserrat’ for headings to add a modern
            touch. I was inspired by minimalist portfolios on sites like
            Awwwards and Behance, which emphasize whitespace, clear typography,
            and intuitive navigation. Before coding, I created a wireframe in
            Figma to plan the layout and user flow. This helped me visualize
            spacing, component placement, and overall usability. Below is the
            initial Figma mockup:
